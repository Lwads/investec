# investec assessment 
* Please note that the project is a maven project and you will need maven setup to run it , reason is I have used 1 of maven dependency to map json to an object.

* For question 1(Highest common factor) , calls are on the Main.java class , you have to run the main method to execute the code and its dependencies.

* Question 2 calls are all dependent in MainAddresses.java and are called through main method as well.
* json file is being referenced under resources folder in the project
