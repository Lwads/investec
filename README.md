# investec assessment 
Please note that the project is a maven project and you will need maven setup to run it , reason is I have used 1 of maven dependency to map json to an object
For question 1(Highest commond factor) , calls are on the Main.java class , you have to run the main method to execute the code.
Question 2 calls are MainAddresses.java and are called through main method as well
json file is being referenced under resources folder in the project
